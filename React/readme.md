## Entire commands that used in the course are following:

Previously i used npm but for this project i tried yarn cause it was recommended by instructure.  

`npm install --global yarn`

Check that Yarn is installed by running:

`yarn --version`

`yarn global add create-react-app@1.5.2`

`npx create-react-app@1.5.2 confusion`

### Note: I got this error message
A template was not provided. This is likely because you're using an outdated version of create-react-app.
Please note that global installs of create-react-app are no longer supported.
You can fix this by running npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app before using create-react-app again.

`yarn global remove create-react-app`
